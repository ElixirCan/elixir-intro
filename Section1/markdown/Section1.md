## Why should you learn the Elixir programming langauge?
1. Concurrency: Can run thousands of lightweight processes which can communicate with processes on different machines.
2. Fault Tolerant: The use of supervisers which can restart processes when they fail or die
3. Fun and Easy to learn: Lots of quality video tutorials, courses, projects, and textbooks
4. Excellent choice for web development: Due to excellent Phoenix framework and ability to run thousands of processes

## Why functional programming?
1. Functional Programming does not have the complexity of trying to understand the state of an object
2. Testing is very easy in functional programming because you do not have to worry about stae of objects
3. Helps break down Complex problems down step by step
4. helps code redability: functions read like a reciepe to transform data
5. Concurrency: which allows thousands of processes to run all at the same time
