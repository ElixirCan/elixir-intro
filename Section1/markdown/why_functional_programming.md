# Why functional programming?
1. Functional Programming does not have the complexity of trying to understand the state of an object
2. Testing is very easy in functional programming because you do not have to worry about stae of objects
3. Helps break down Complex problems down step by step
4. helps code redability: functions read like a reciepe to transform data
5. Concurrency: which allows thousands of processes to run all at the same time
