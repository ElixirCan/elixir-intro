## Processes & Concurrency 
- Elixir has what is called Processes which can be summed up as seperate actions which can send and recieve messsages between each other.
- Elixir can run thousands of processes **Concurrently** which means that they run at the same time seperate from each other process
- Elixir Processes can be acessed through their own PID(Process ID)
